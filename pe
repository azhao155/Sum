User vs Kernel:

User mode and kernel mode are terms that may refer specifically to the processor execution mode. Code that runs in kernel mode can fully [1] control the CPU while code that runs in user mode has certain limitations. For example, local CPU interrupts can only be disabled or enable while running in kernel mode. If such an operation is attempted while running in user mode an exception will be generated and the kernel will take over to handle it.
